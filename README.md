## Development

!> Still a lot to add and check, including content beyond Chapter 1.

!>  'section_*' identifiers refer to the way content and code is structured in the Android app. They're **not** a reference back to the Story book.

?> The scripted output hasn't been validated, there *may* be errors or missing content.

?> Pagination should probably be removed.........

- Download the Oathsworn APK
- Open in JADX
- Save as Gradle project in directory called `decomp`
- Run `python web.py`
  - This will generate `/output` which links to files in `/decomp`
  - Need a way to keep track of places and to link "place location 22 and go there" with its associated section ID.
