[chp2b_24_1__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2b_24_1__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Location 24 – The Burrows

Mud and slop fill the streets as you wade through the rain of the Burrows. Here, a warren of tightly packed terraces cross and recross each other as they have been added to again and again over the years in an attempt to create more space. As you walk under one of the overhead walkways something splashes on the back of your hand. Not rain, blood. You look up and see a dark room connecting to the walkway. Climbing a nearby staircase you find the door to the room ajar, a line of blood running from its entrance.

Upon entry you see two forms lying prone on the floor, thick shadows draped over them. A male and a female of middling age. They are covered in scratch marks and bruises. Household objects lie around the couple, broken and obviously used upon each other. These people killed one another. What could have possessed them to…

A movement in the corner of the room catches your eye. Your hands go to your weapon. A pair of eyes peer out from the shadow and a boy's face appears. He is no more than his twelfth year, his clothes dirty and his feet bare. He just stares at his parents.

You try to talk to him to find out what happened, but he remains silent. He seems broken somehow, unable to speak of the horror he witnessed. It seems Bastone will have another street urchin before long when people find the room unclaimed.
