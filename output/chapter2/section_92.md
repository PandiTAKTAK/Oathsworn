## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2_60_7__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2_60_7__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

You sneak past Tam, his eyes certainly a sentry for this creature. On the other side of the space you find Tam has not been alone in his confinement. A macabre display of human marionettes hang contorted from numerous branches in the trees beyond. There, in the middle of them is the beast, hunched over the broken form it carried from the wall, delicately lashing the body to a broken tree limb. Now is the time to strike. Charging from the trees you bellow a challenge and its ugly horned head rises. Giant orange eyes meet yours.
