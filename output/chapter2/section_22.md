"Excellent. I want that man's head on a spike. These cockroaches have to learn their place. Now, my men have been hunting The Piper for some time.

Well, I call it treason. I'm sure they are operating close to their hideout. I am no hunter, but I am sure if you follow the circles you'll find your man."
