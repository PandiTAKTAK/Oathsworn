Time Triggered Story

The market is bustling, even at this hour. Men and women, young and old, hurry about bartering and trading their often meager wares. Samil stands perfectly still in the center of the crowd, head cocked to one side, staring at you. You know something is about to happen here. Someone is about to die, but who? If you can stop this you might be able to track down the source of your dreams.

Scanning the crowd, you see three distinct groups. A gang of children are dispersed amongst the stalls. Some are playing, others are keeping watch to see if the stall owners are distracted. On the other side of the market is a group of older men huddled around a table discussing a trade. Lastly, dispersed in the center, is a group of women.
