## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2_10_2__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2_10_2__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

"Oh, Vile!" the servant spits. "Warden? Thatâ€¦ thing, cannot enter my Lord's presence," pointing to the witch. "No disrespect to one of the Inquisition, but I humbly request you stay with it to protect us all." The servant spits again toward himself, then ushers the rest of the Free Company into the antichamber, leaving you with a number of the Lord's personal retinue. They eye your witch with visible hatred and one spits in her face as she stares vehemently back.

"My lord warden," one of them pipes up. "We don't know how you teach your pets in Verum, but we make sure they learn not to look us in the eye like that here." He takes a step forward and grips an iron cudgel, "May we show your pet some manners?"


The Warden must choose one:

[1. Nod to let the man strike your witch](output/chapter2/section_11.md)

[2. Backhand the man](output/chapter2/section_12.md)

[3. Release control of your witch for a second](output/chapter2/section_13.md)
