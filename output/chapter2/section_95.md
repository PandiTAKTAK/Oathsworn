THE DEEPWOOD

The Satyr shudders, ichor seeping from a dozen cuts. It seems to be smiling even now as if it relishes the pain. Advancing on the fiend to finish it off the Satyr raises its mighty arms and darklight wreathes the clearing. Your vision twists and blurs and when it returns the Satyr is gone. No tracks, just gone. You hope it has gone somewhere to die, but you doubt it. Wherever it went, it will think twice before preying on Bastone again.

You go to see if any of the people in the trees are still alive, but find them long dead, their bodies broken and twisted. You hope they died quickly. A search of the surrounding area gleans several items.

Losing the light fast, you hurry back to Bastone. There you find Gamel the Banksmith watching from the walls awaiting your return.

'My boy, did you find him?'
