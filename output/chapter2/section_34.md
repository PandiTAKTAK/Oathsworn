You find yourself in a quiet street, the clues of the orange circles leading you to this singular spot. At first glance this is a street like any other until you notice the well. Looking over the lip there seems to be no water at the bottom. The inner walls of the shaft are lined with uneven splotches of orange paint, a thousand eyes staring at each other.

A set of handholds have been carved into the well walls, forming a stone ladder down into the dark below.
