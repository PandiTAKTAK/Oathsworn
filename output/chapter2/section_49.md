## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2b_5_1__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2b_5_1__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Location 5 â€“ The Barracks

As soon as you mention dreams to the guardsmen you approach, they look at you in fear like you have the power to see into their minds.

"Have you seen her?" the guard says in a barely audible whisper. "THE WOMAN IN BLACK. We've all seen her. Every night."

When you press him, he has no recollection of a face, a place, or anything. But each of the guards has been seeing a WOMAN IN BLACK, and each of the guards is terrified by her, fearing she will do something to them.

As you ask for more details, each guard simply backs away. As one steps away, behind him stands Samil. Samil reaches for you and is yanked quickly back into nothingness with the sound of a thrum of the Wire Road.
