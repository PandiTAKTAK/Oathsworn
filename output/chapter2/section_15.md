Location 2 â€“ The Archive

"Six attacks have been recorded. Four patrols lost," Archivist Millus explains, pointing at the record. "We don't have enough guards to have them murdered in the streets by rabble. With fewer guards, robberies go up, productivity goes down. There's a system here. The guards are the timbers that hold it together. They fall, Bastone falls. It's simple math."

Satisfied that the records support everything you're being told, you head back out.

Leaving the Archives, you see a bedraggled man standing in an alleyway across the street staring at a wall, swaying in a wind that no one feels.

Moving closer, you see he is staring at two, large, orange circles painted carefully on the alley wall.
