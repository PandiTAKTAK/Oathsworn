Thistle vines tear at your arms as you dash by tortured tree trunks and splash through the soggy underbrush, desperate to distance yourselves from the encroaching beast. You know it is there, but dare not turn to look. Don't trip. Your heart clenches as you feel the hot animal breath at your back. Your weapon, where is it? The thing is gaining. The thudding footfalls pound in your ears. A rising shadow looms over you. Then… nothing. No more branches being torn behind. No more splashing. You slow, then walk and eventually stop, breathless and terrified.

You look to one another. Samil comes up, the last of you as always. He wipes his brow and shakes his head.

"It's gone," he says adjusting his leather strap breastplate with one hand and grabbing the Wire Road with the other. You return his faint smile and face back to the path. Suddenly, there is a loud, plucked thrum on the wire behind you. You turn as Samil is pulled screaming into the Deepwood. Something huge surges from the trees, orange eyes flashing.
