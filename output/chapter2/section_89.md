Making sure there is no danger, you step out into the open space motioning to Tam to stay quiet. The boy locks onto you and immediately begins to scream and thrash about, creating a cacophony from the objects in the vines above.

You go immediately on the defensive. The boy is killing himself. The barbed vines around Tam cut deeply into his neck as he thrashes, draining the life from him. You have no time to help the boy though, as something approaches.

You feel it before you see it. A primal fear washes over you. You see two cloven hooves, then gaze slowly upward into the trees to be met by two giant orange eyes staring back.
