Time Triggered StoryBolting for the alley, you are determined to track down this murderer. This witch? Or whatever it was. It does not take long. The alley leads to the outer wall and as you run along the straight path you see a figure atop the wall. As you close you realize it is a woman dressed in black swaying in a wind no one else feels. Why is she not escaping? The question is muted as you alight the stone stairway.

Samil stands next to the woman. He leans in, whispers in her ear, and gestures out to the Deepwood as if offering her a seat. The woman nods with a smile and steps to the edge.
