Location 6 – The Church

Mourners line the steps of the church. A guard stands nervously at the base of the steps. You ask if he knows why everyone has gathered.

"Yeah, I know. I found him myself. Reverend Kuthnell. They… sacrificed him on his own altar… Nothing's safe no more."

You try to talk to some of the mourners, most pay you little heed but one suggests the apothecary may know of such things. As you leave, the crowd parts before you, but one man stands in your way.

Samil, head cocked to one side, stares at you in disappointment.

You hear the loud thrum of the Wire Road and Samil is gone.
