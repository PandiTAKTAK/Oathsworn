Time Triggered Story

There are three women in black that you can see. They are a distance from each other. Your sense of foreboding rises. It's happening. You must choose now. Which woman is it? One stands by a Tinker's stall looking over the ironwork tools and cutlery. One is buying meat from a Butcher. One is talking to a Carpenter whittling by the roadside.
