Location 6 – The Church

Mourners line the steps of the church. A lone guard maintains order amongst the crowd, but you take note of his obviously nervous demeanor. You approach the guard and ask him why everyone has gathered.

"Reverend Kuthnell. They… sacrificed him on his own altar. I found him myself. Nothing's safe no more."

You proceed to scan the immediate area, looking for the orange circles that Lord Davenish mentioned. Your eyes lock onto a familiar face - Samil. His haunting eyes stare at you in silent disappointment.

You press toward him, pushing your way between the mourners, when suddenly you hear the loud thrum of the Wire Road. In a blink, Samil is gone. As you reach the spot where he was standing, you find circles daubed on the stone walkway.
