You give chase, having to batter down part of the wall to squeeze through the hole. On the other side, the smell of wet earth greets you and you see roots and mushrooms growing in patches along the walls. You must be in an Underways tunnel. From further down the passage you can hear running footsteps through puddles. You set off at a run, trying to gain ground.

You wind your way through the tunnels, your mark always just beyond sight. He knows these paths and you are encumbered. You fear you might lose him. Then, turning a corner you see feet disappearing upwards. A ladder reaches to a hatch in the ceiling. Taking two rungs at a time you burst through the hatch, coming out at the foot of the outer wall of Bastone.

You can make out The Piper standing atop the wall, he has stopped as if waiting for you. Cautiously you ascend the stone stairway to find Samil standing next to the man. Samil leans in, whispers in his ear, and gestures out to the Deepwood as if offering the man a seat. The Piper nods with a smile and steps to the edge.
