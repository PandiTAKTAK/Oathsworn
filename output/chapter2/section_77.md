You close on the woman by the Butcher as she plucks the knife from the Butcher's belt. He begins to give protest, but then backs away, terrified of what he sees in her face. She turns and you catch a glint of orange pass over her eyes as she strides into the crowd.

You push bystanders aside in an attempt to reach her. She is heading for a nobleman, the weapon held low. She draws back her arm to strike and rams it forward. The closest of you catches her wrist, forcing her to drop the blade.

Realizing the blow will not land, the woman screams, and like one possessed, rakes you with her nails and bites at your face.
