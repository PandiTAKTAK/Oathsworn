!>**EACH OATHSWORN CHOOSES WHETHER TO PLAY OR NOT.  EACH ONE THAT CHOOSES TO PLAY MUST PLACE 1 IRON INTO THE CENTER OF PLAY.  PLACE 2 IRON FROM THE SUPPLY IN THE CENTER OF PLAY TO REPRESENT THE OTHER PLAYERS.  EACH OATHSWORN THAT PLACED 1 IRON PERFORMS A GAMBLING CHECK.  AFTER ALL CARDS ARE DRAWN, EACH OATHSWORN MAY, ONCE, PLACE 1 IRON INTO THE CENTER OF PLAY TO REDRAW ONE CARD.  IF ANY OATHSWORN CHECK IS ABOVE 6, THE FREE COMPANY GAINS ALL THE IRON IN THE CENTER OF PLAY AND ALL OATHSWORN GAIN A REDRAW TOKEN.  IF NO OATHSWORN CHECK IS HIGHER THAN 6, PLACE THE IRON IN THE SUPPLY.**
