## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2_13_10__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2_13_10__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

The street urchin you remember from your arrival in Bastone puts his hand down on your table.

"A message for you from High Lord Davenish. This is official business here. He wants you at the palace. I ran here fast as the streets would take me and I've done my best to give you a good name and not disappoint his High Lord. Yet another show of my usefulness and good faith and all. Due to that, I am willing to let you reconsider having me as a faithful and well paid guide."

He smiles, "I'll throw in today's message as a free delivery to show my character and, from here on in, the rest is negotiable."
