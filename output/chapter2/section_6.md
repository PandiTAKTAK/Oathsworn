## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

The Banksmith, Gamel, enters the tavern, clearly agitated. He heads to Greycane and urgently puts a three-fingered hand on his shoulder.

Greycane turns to the man, concern on his face, "What is it, old friend?"

"Tam. Have you seen him? He's not come home," Gamel replies.

"You know what youth are like. I think you might even have been one once. With a face like that you must have gotten yourself lost more than once," he says encouragingly to the thick-armed Banksmith. Bram lets out a short laugh clearly deciding Gamel has a face only a mother could love.

Gamel eyes Bram briefly before continuing, "Please. He's all I have."

"Of course," replies Greycane. "I'll put out word for him with my contacts."

Gamel nods gratefully and leaves the tavern. Greycane shakes his head, "Hmm. He's not the first to be looking for someone. Tam is a good one. Perhaps he has intentionally gotten himself lost, but my gut tells me otherwiseâ€¦"

As the silence lingers, your eye is drawn to the window of the Tavern. Staring back at you through the glass, unmoving, is Samil, your fallen comrade - face gaunt, eyes accusing. You blink and he is gone. As you rise from your seat, you are interrupted.
