Location 3 â€“ The Apothecary

Situated on top of a tenement building surrounded by a garden of herbs, you arrive at the small hut of the town's lone apothecary, Lyceen. The colorful plants are a stark contrast to the slate black roofs and brown timbers of the rest of the town. It strikes you that there is no crowd outside the establishment. Apothecaries normally have a hive of people jostling about, waiting to have their ills tended to. Here there are none.

As you come closer you see why. Hastily scrawled in jagged letters, the word 'witch' stretches across the entire side of the hut. Lyceen tries in vain to scrub away the carved letters with a rough stone. She pauses as she takes note of your presence, but does not turn to address you.

"Come to collect a witch?" she asks, scrubbing harder now. "That's what the crowds want, isn't it? If you don't, they will. This doesn't end well for me regardless."

You stay alert with this woman, but you know better than most that only a handful of witch hunts actually involve a witch.


Choose one:

[1. Ask her why people suspect her of being a witch](output/chapter2/section_17.md)

[2. Avoid town politics and get straight to asking about the circles and rebels](output/chapter2/section_18.md)
