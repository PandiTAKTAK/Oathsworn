You tell Gamel how the Satyr killed his son. An uncommon anger rises in Gamel and brokenness pours out of him. 'I knew he was gone. I felt it in my gut. I knew. Why didn't I go after him? That thing's still alive somewhere. I vow by my good arm I'll kill that creature. I WILL have vengeance, Free Company. I don't care how long it takes or how much blood is spilt. I'm coming with you.'
