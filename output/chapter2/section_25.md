## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2a_15_1__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2a_15_1__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Location 15 â€“ The Shades

As you travel up the oddly angled alleyways, you hear a deep, male voice bellow from around a corner. "Come on then! Who wants to die first?"

You pick up speed, drawing your weapons. Turning a blind corner, you find a thick-armed, brute of a man standing between a gang of men and a woman with two small children. The children cower against a wet wall, underneath clearly painted orange circles. Ten men with torn shirts wielding animal bones and wooden spikes close in on them.

One of the ten turns at your approach saying, "Have you come to witness justice, Oathsworn? This man is an enforcer for the guild, he protects the rich and abandons his own kind. Do not interfere."
