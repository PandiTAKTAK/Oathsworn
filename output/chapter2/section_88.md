## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

[chp2_60_3__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp2_60_3__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

There is a strange gentle sobbing as you approach an open space between the trees. Weapons drawn, you crouch and shelter behind trunks as you work your way toward it.

Hanging from a branch lashed by vines that dig deep into his arms is a young boy, struggling to catch each gulping breath. The vines above him are twisted like a rope, run-through with broken weapons, pots, bones and sticks. They clatter slightly in the swaying breeze. Any motion would cause a tremendous racket. His belt has been torn and lies several feet below him in the leaves, a large black hammer still tucked into it, never drawn to fight off whatever did this to him.

Tam. The Banksmith's son. His half-open eyes showing the unnatural orange you saw before. He scans the woods with a hypnotic gaze as if looking for something.

The large bulk you have been following lumbers in the treeline past this clearing.
