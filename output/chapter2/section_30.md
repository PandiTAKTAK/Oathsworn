## Chapter 2 - Eyes in the Dark

Location 19 – The Banksmith

Gamel the Banksmith half-heartedly nods as you enter.

"Bad days," Gamel snorts, wiping oil from his hands on a leather towel. "Worse nights," he continues, speaking to no one.

"Seen my boy? Tam?" he asks as he tiredly gestures to his wares on display. "You come and tell me the second you do, right? He's… been out of sorts. Screaming in the night like a witch had him. Anyway… let's move on. Do your business."
