Location 3 â€“ The Apothecary

On top of a tenement building you find the apothecary. Her small hut is surrounded by a garden of herbs, the greens a stark contrast to the slate black roofs and brown timbers of the rest of the town. It strikes you that there is no crowd outside. Every apothecary you have ever seen has been accompanied by a hive of people jostling to have their ills tended to. Here, there was no one.

As you come closer you see why. Hastily scrawled letters proclaim 'witch' on the side of the hut and its lone window is broken.

Lyceen sits slumped on a stool, herbs, powders and several rocks scattered about the floor. She holds a bloody rag to her head.

"Come to collect a witch?" she asks, looking up painfully. "That's what the crowds want, isn't it? If you don't, they will. I've a growing collection of rocks to tell me that."

You stay alert with this woman, but you know better than most that only a handful of witch hunts actually involve a witch.
