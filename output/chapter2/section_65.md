You take some food from your pack and offer it to the boy. He resists at first, but hunger wins out and he devours the scraps of dried meat. He cannot give you his name, so you must give him one.

You coax the boy from the room and out into the rain. It starts to wash the blood from his feet.

You place a blanket around him, and for better or worse, you take him with you.
