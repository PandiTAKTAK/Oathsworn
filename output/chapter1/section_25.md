Location 13 – The Broken Oak

A well-tended inn shows promise. Entering, you find an amber fire glowing in the hearth. It is warm, dry and seemingly inviting.

"Pot's Peace!" a burly man says smiling. His eyes are slightly distant, revealing that his attitude may come more from a bottle than his heart. "The yams are fresh and the rum's dark as the Deepwood."

A newcomer steps up beside him. "Things are not fresh just because they are green, Bram, especially if they're supposed to be yellow." He turns to you. "He tries at least and he's not lying about the rum… Greycane," the man introduces himself with a nod of deference. "I am the eyes and ears of this town."

"The mouth, more like," Bram offers from behind the bar.

"I am also the bankroll of this establishment," he retorts with a knowing look at Bram.

After a few pleasantries, Greycane leads the conversation around to the question of what he can do for a Free Company in Bastone. Hearing of your hunt, a light appears in his eyes.

"The Son of Lord Arden's been the talk of the town. Word is he had been frequenting a certain sort of alley being less than noble. That's where they found his seal, the noble crest, bathed in blood. No body. The crust blame the common folk, but I think it's something else and I'm glad Davinish had the forethought to call you in."
