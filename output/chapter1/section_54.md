## Chapter 1 - Bastone

!>**TWO PATHS LAY BEFORE YOU. DO YOU TRY TO FIND THIS INFORMANT AND SEE WHAT HE KNOWS, OR DO YOU SEARCH THE TOWN FOR OTHER CLUES TO THE MURDERS? YOU KNOW YOU WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO DO BOTH.

IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 6 IRON YOU MUST CHOOSE TO SEARCH THE TOWN FOR OTHER CLUES TO THE MURDERS.**

### You easily pull the iron latch pin from the stockade. Randle massages his wrists. "Pot's Peace shine upon you, my friends. I owe you." You tell him what you need and he readily agrees to tell you what he knows. "There's this old body collector over in the Burrows. He's had me looking for a buyer for a story he's selling. Says he knows who's responsible for the deaths. He'll want paying proper, though."

Choose one:

[Try to find the informant to see what he knows](output/chapter1/section_56.md)

[Search the town for other clues to the murders.](output/chapter1/section_82.md)
