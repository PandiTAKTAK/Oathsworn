Location 24 â€“ The Burrows

You find the informant on the other side of town as daylight begins to wane.

He is not much to look at. Just another grimy face. He nervously shifts from foot to foot outside a ramshackle terrace. Behind him you can see what must be his family peering nervously from a window. They look hungry.

"You need words, we need food, 3 iron and I'll tell you what you're needing."


Choose one:

[1. Try to barter with the man](output/chapter1/section_72.md)

[2. Give the man what he asks for and a little something extra. His family looks like they need it](output/chapter1/section_76.md)

[3. Threaten the man to get what you need without paying](output/chapter1/section_73.md)
