## Chapter 1 - Bastone

[chp1_4_4__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp1_4_4__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

You squeeze through the hatch into a dark maze of rough-hewn passages, your torches glowing pale blue in the noxious air. Ankle-deep in waste and muck, you slog through winding tunnels, kicking aside rats and brushing away cobwebs, looking for any clue as to what might be behind this.

Around one corner you stop. There is a splashing. A thick heavy motion lumbers toward you from a shadowy side passage. Sounds of chittering and nervous clicking conjure memories of past ambushes prompting each of you to draw your weapons.

Whatever it is, it is low and hunched. This is no rat. This is something much larger and it's moving fast.
