### Location 20 – The Stockades

There are five stockades in the circle. Only one is currently occupied. A soggy young man with thick, curly red hair sits dejectedly in the rain. A solitary guard leans under an archway not far off paying little heed.

At the sight of you the man brightens, "Psst! Hey. Can you help me? Honest, I didn't do nothing. It's the guards: corrupt as witchcraft. Iron's more important than blood to them. You're Free Company, right? You can do what you want. Come on. Just lift that pin and I'll do anything."

You have the power to requisition this man if he has what you need.
