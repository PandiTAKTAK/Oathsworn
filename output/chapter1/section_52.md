Location 19 â€“ The Banksmith

You trudge the muddy streets and find the Banksmith. The building is made fully from brick rather than a cobbled clay and timber affair like most of the town. It is large and imposing like the two guards at its entrance. Gamel, the Banksmith, is a broad-shouldered man wearing a woven knot apron of fine leather, highlighted with years of coal and grease. The air in the room moves like murky water, heavy with soot and the smell of the forge. Looking behind the Banksmith, you can see iron ingots stacked high. A considerable wealth.

"If you need shaping, I can do that. Want to exchange goods, my son Tam would usually take care of you, though I've not seen him today. He's got more fingers for the math," says the Banksmith, holding up a hand with only three digits.

The Banksmith wants to talk business and nothing more. As soon as you use words like murder, he suddenly decides another customer is more important so you grudgingly head back out into the rain.
