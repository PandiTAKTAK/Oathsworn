### You squeeze through the small hole and find yourselves in the no man's land between the city walls and the Deepwood. You look off to the treeline and check your compass. This item is near sacred to you as well as all Free Companies. It is the only chance you have of navigating your way back after you enter the Deepwood. You steel yourselves and head in.

"She won't be far," Sedric says, looking around nervously. He had asked to come and you start to wonder why, but then remember you could ask yourself the same question. Sedric easily leads you along a trail of sickly brush, torn and trampled by many feet.

Something large moves and you crouch to watch. Sedric stifles an excited laugh. The rat has a silhouette the size of a wolf, but low and barrel-like with a smell of rot emanating from it. It has not seen you yet, and in the hopes of keeping it that way, one of you draws a blade and lashes out, burying it deep into the thing's skull. It was a solid kill, but as the hissing sound rises around you, you realize it was futile.

The Deepwood bursts with vile life as the hulking ratlike form of the Broodmother parts the branches to your side. Her back undulates with rats that swarm around her as she lifts her huge snout, testing the air. Her great head of rotten fur and gnawing teeth rolls towards you and, with a ravenous hunger, her eyes meet yours.
