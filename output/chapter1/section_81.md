With the screeching finally silenced, the mass of rotted fur lies still. Taking no chances, you hack off the Broodmother's head and burn the body. The Deepwood may snuff out the flames, but it will at least consume this corruption. In the den you find several items of value.

When you arrive back at Bastone, you are met by a squad of guards.

"Our Lord Davenish heard of your foray into the Deepwood. Have you found the beast?" says the Sergeant.

You raise the severed head of the Broodmother to the guard's face. The men recoil.

"Wellâ€¦ well done. I have been instructed to give you this iron in payment and to tell you that Lord Davenish would meet with you tomorrow morning. He has paid for your lodgings at The Broken Oak Inn during your stay. I would suggest retiring there now as his lordship will not suffer tardiness tomorrow."

You hand the guard the head and take the iron.
