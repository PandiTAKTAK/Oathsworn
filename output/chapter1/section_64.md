## Chapter 1 - Bastone

[chp1_22_6__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp1_22_6__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Dozens of streets and alleys spread out like a spider web from the town gates. You have lived in Verum so a small, gnarled burg like Bastone should be easy enough to find your way around. You're sure you'll be able to pick up the trail and that there may even be a Banksmith or Apothecary to trade with for the supplies you may need for the hunt.
