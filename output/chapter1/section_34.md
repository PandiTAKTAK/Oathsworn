[chp1_17_1a_a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp1_17_1a_a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Location 17 â€“ The Eastern Tower

You know you won't be able to find the collector before nightfall but you know exactly where the guards will be. Catching sight of the tower the man told you of, you head for the outer wall.

The weather is worsening and rain runs down the stairway leading up Bastone's outer wall. You ascend the gray stone steps in search of the guards. It does not take long to find them. A squad is hunched around a brazier of slow burning amber, water tapping off their iron pot helms.

You close the distance, shouting through the rain, "Are you the night watch?"

"Who's asking?" one of them grunts giving you a brief sidelong glance before returning his gaze to the fire. Then he looks back, eyeing the mark on your wrists. Understanding dawns on him, and his eyes widen in fear. He goes to draw his sword as the other four turn to face you.



**Choose one:**

[1. Attempt to threaten the squad](output/chapter1/section_35.md)

[2. Attempt to barter with them](output/chapter1/section_38.md)

[3. Attempt to reason with them](output/chapter1/section_39.md)
