Location 11 â€“ A Tower

This tower overlooks the Wire Road that trails up to Bastone. The guards grudgingly let you investigate the area. It actually seems to be one of the better kept areas and you are followed cautiously while you ask a few questions and poke around. It is soon clear that nothing here is out of order.
