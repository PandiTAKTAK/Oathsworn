## Chapter 1 - Bastone

[chp1_17_8__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp1_17_8__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

You come to a point in the parapet where faint blood stains can be seen on the crenellations. Peering over the wall you find what you have been looking for. At its base are the thick wooden stakes used in all settlements to ward off the denizens of the Deepwood. Among these stakes is also a matted mass of blood soaked grass and earth in the center of which is a small mound of corpses. You imagine these are fresh as this much meat would not last longer than a day in the Deepwood. This flesh pile is what calls the thing or things to the town.

Oddly, you also see a rope hanging down from the parapet. Looking between the branches and limbs of the black trees you make out a figure. What could possess a person to go into the Deepwood alone? You have no time to ponder this as the figure rushes back toward the wall. Then you see them, a pack of giant rats the size of wolves enter your view, galloping across the space. A horde of festering fur and yellow teeth close in on a man in guard's uniform. He won't make it and he knows it. He turns and bellows defiantly at the rats as they hiss back.


Choose one:

[1. Climb down the wall and come to the man's aid](output/chapter1/section_43.md)

[2. Give up the man for dead and throw a flaming brazier of explosive amber off the wall down on them both](output/chapter1/section_44.md)
