### The guard seals the paper with wax and nods to those outside the portcullis. With a slow grind, the iron gate raises to let you through. You understand your task - find whoever or whatever is responsible for the unexplained deaths. As you step out onto the main thoroughfare of Bastone, a sea of unwashed citizens churn through the mud going about their daily struggle.

"Welcome to my glorious Bastone," a voice chimes from your right.

You all turn to the voice. A street urchin, caked in dirt under an explosion of dark hair, leans nonchalantly against the outer wall.

"If I hadn't been so clever I might have tried to lighten your pockets. Looks like you're too much for me though, right? You come out of the green all bristling with blades fresh from the wire. Nope, me ma made no fool and that's why I'll let you pass without paying my toll."

"Now, I know what you're thinking, we need that kind of charitable citizen to show us around. Well usually I'd say no, what with all my other responsibilities around town. But for you, I make an exception. 4 iron a day and I make this place feel like home for you. Get you anything or anyone you need, take you anywhere you want and keep you from running into the less reputable round here."
