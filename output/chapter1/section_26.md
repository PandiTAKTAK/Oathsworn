## Chapter 1 - Bastone

[chp1_14_1__a](../../decomp/app/src/main/res/raw/chp1_14_1__a.mp3 ':include :type=audio')

Location 14 â€“ The Town Square

Smells of cooking pots and the sound of fervent bartering roll over you. Glancing around, you meet the eyes of the destitute peering from dark alleys and crooked doorways. The square itself seethes with people who retreat to give your party a wide berth when they notice you, creating an island in the roiling sea of bodies.

You come to another area bereft of people. At the heart of the square is a ten foot tall iron post driven permanently into the flagstones. Heavy links hang from welded bolts and a large ring of black soot scores the area at its base. Others you have seen of this kind are made from wood. How many people are they burning to warrant one made from iron?

You canvas the area and discover that this functions as a crossroads between east and west Bastone and it seems no violent deaths have been discovered in West Bastone.
