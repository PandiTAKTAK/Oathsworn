### The man leans on his sword visibly shaking, then stands straight collecting himself.

"You saved my life. Thank you." The man turns to you as he cleans himself up. "I am Dane. I, I had to try and save her. Stupid to think I could. There were so many of them. For weeks now they have been throwing bodies off the wall and I was too cowardly to try to stop them. Then they threw her over. She was still alive. I saw her crawling. Then the rats came and dragged her into the trees. She may still be alive. Help me. Help her."

You inspect one of the rat corpses as he explains. You note the length of the tail, the color of the teeth and the clawed paws. This was a pup, not full grown. You know rats have dozens of pups…dozens. Where's the mother though? A woman's scream pierces the Deepwood behind you. You're about to find out.

Choose one:

[1. Let Dane join you on the hunt](output/chapter1/section_51.md)

[2. Send him back up the wall and head in without him](output/chapter1/section_49.md)
