### Location 15 – The Shades

Heading up the street you believe is the right choice, you push through crowds and navigate around huddled clumps of the homeless, squatting toad-like around small fires. The barking of vendors eventually gives way to sobbing and indistinct mewling noises as you enter a series of shadowed alleys. There are fewer and fewer people here and darkness hugs the street as you make your way up a narrowing avenue.

You approach a ragged, cloaked figure as he daubs small, white circles on the wall with paint coated fingers. There are hundreds of them. He does not fully turn, but speaks in creaking tones over his shoulder.

"Have you seen it? Has it seen you? Do you know the truth the Deepwood brings, as we do?"

He turns, drawing a sickle from under his cloak. His distant gaze falls on you.

The shadows burst with movement. With your attention drawn to the strange figure, you hadn't noticed the ambush you have walked into.
