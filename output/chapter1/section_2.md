### Location 3 – The Apothecary

You have heard there is an Apothecary of sorts in this quarter, situated on the rooftop of a tenement. When you arrive you find a stand-alone shack surrounded by gardens and a queue of people.

Forcing your way to the door you enter and find a room which is something between a library, a curiosity shop and a vegetable stand. A young woman is hunched over a man sitting on a stool, tending a wound.

"Wait your turn," the woman says angrily without looking up. When you make no move to leave, she wheels on you, then stops.

A moment of panic crosses her face, but she quickly rights herself, "Oathsworn…You'd better be dying or know someone who's dying to barge in like this…"

You assuage her concerns and tell her you want to know about the rising body count in the town. "Well I wouldn't know about that. The dead don't tend to come to me for pulses, now do they?"

"No survivors?" you ask.

"None that I heard of. Not that I go looking. I've got enough to handle here with the living." She turns back to the man on the stool. As she does, a rock crashes through the lone window in the room, showering it with glass.

"You killed my Da!! You Witch!" Comes a small boy's voice from outside. "She cursed him, I saw it!" This is followed by the sound of small feet running away across the rooftop.

The apothecary is visibly shaken. You ask her what that was about, but she busies herself picking up glass and refuses to talk any further. If she knew anything, she was not forthcoming about it and will be less so now.
