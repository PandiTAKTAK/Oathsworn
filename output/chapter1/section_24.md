Location 12 â€“ The Market

The Market square is filled with vendors hawking wares from carts and tables. The sounds of people shouting and the smell of smoked meats and root vegetables fill the air. Dozens of hunched and tired shoulders make their way from one trade to the next.

You split up and casually shop the meager food supplies while keeping your eyes and ears open.

After nearly an hour, you regroup. The tales you hear shed some light on the situation if only by the absence of anything specific. No one recalls a killing on this side of town. Everyone is tired. They complain of fearful dreams and eyes in the dark keeping them awake at night. A tinkerer hung himself in his kitchen last week. Many blame the dreams for driving him mad, though others say it is just the way of the world.
