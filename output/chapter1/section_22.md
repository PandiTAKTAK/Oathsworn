Location 7 â€“ The Underways

Ancient wooden doors mark the entrance to the underways below the city. Inside, looming passages of moist soil, well timbered up and tended, lead ever downward. Women with tied back hair carry buckets of roots or yokes of water on their shoulders as men work the dark loam, sweating in the dull glow of amber lanterns.

"I know my workers and you are not them," an authoritative female voice announces. It is a slight woman with bright eyes, dressed in a man's leather farm clothes. She points at your wrists fearlessly. "Oathsworn. Good. Let's make this fast. I am Celeste. Overseer."

You explain why you are here. She takes it in and replies, "Nothing amiss down here, yeah, in the past three months. I have lost four, but that has all been above ground. Suicide? Witches? Whatever else stalks the damned streets above. You tell me. I have my men leave in pairs now. No one walks alone upside. Only fool runners like Randle do that. And I've not seen him. He's probably face down in a ditch or face down in that inn the boys go to."
