After several hours, you eventually find a junction that runs along the outer wall of the city. You can see the Deepwood through the hole where a mammoth foundation stone has somehow shifted. Blood trails concentrate on this point from all directions as if bodies or body parts have been forced through the gap. The trail carries through the opening and leads off into the Deepwood. In the blood stains you make out the tracks of several clawed footprints. You get the distinct impression there is more than one of these things.


Choose one:

[1. Set a trap for these things and wait for them to return to the hole](output/chapter1/section_12.md)

[2. Squeeze through the hole and follow the trail while it is fresh](output/chapter1/section_17.md)
