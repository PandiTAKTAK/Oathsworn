The place Sedric leads you to is a junction that runs along the outer wall of the city. You know this as you can see the treeline of the Deepwood through a hole where a solitary foundation stone has somehow shifted out of place. Blood stains highlight the opening on all sides, concentrating on this point, as if bodies or body parts have been forced through the gap.

"He's not alone you know? The rat that bit that arm." You turn, listening to the ratcatcher.

"He was a pup, certainly. They look different. Mothers have dozens of pups," he murmurs, fingering the scores of tracks leading to the hole. "Dozens."

Choose one:

[1. Set a trap for the brood and wait for it to return to the hole](output/chapter1/section_14.md)

[2. Follow the trail while it is fresh](output/chapter1/section_15.md)
