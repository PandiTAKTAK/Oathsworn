## Chapter 1 - Bastone

As you approach the thick wooden gate, a small slat slides unevenly open and a weary, coal-caked face peers out.

Moments pass as he eyes you with suspicion taking inventory of your many weapons. Then one of you reveals the mark on your wrist. He grimaces, "Free Company …eerrr… let me get this open."

The slat slams shut and you hear chains strain as a mechanism pulls the gate open, swinging out just wide enough to squeeze through. You move into the gateway passage and find it blocked ahead by an iron portcullis, a second layer of defense creating a quarantine area. In the passage with you is a single table, lit by a foul smelling lantern on the wall. You hand him your papers.

"I'm sure you know the drill," the guard urges as he thumbs through them.

Arms extended out from your sides, he raps against you repeatedly with a short hollow tube of wood. He nods, then sniffs, satisfied you have brought nothing of the Deepwood in with you.

"You've not come too soon. More bodies last night," he says as he moves to the rickety table in the corner to mark more paperwork. "Papers say you're five."

A grim silence from you answers his next question.

"Right, then. An oath fulfilled I suppose." He looks uncomfortably away and motions toward a log book with ink and quill beside it. "Make your mark."
