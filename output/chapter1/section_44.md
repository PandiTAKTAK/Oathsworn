Orange flames wreathe the fist-sized stones that burn in the iron brazier. You carefully lift the brazier to the lip of the wall and heave it over. Glowing streaks fill the air as the amber rains down on the man and the pack closing in on him. The brazier strikes the amber with a spark and flames engulf the scene below. White light fills your eyes and you instinctively raise your hands to ward them from the heat. A crack like thunder rolls over you and then recedes. You peer over the wall. Charred, twisted bodies and twitching limbs spew smoke. In the middle, you can make out the guard's body. It was a better way to go than what the rats had planned. At least this was quick.

Descending the rope, you go to inspect the carcasses. Half a dozen are scattered around. They must have been attracted by the corpses, then found their way into the town. Crouching beside one of the hideous things you take a closer look.
