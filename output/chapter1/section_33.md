Location 16 – The Watering Hole

Rain trickles from an ill-hanging sign proclaiming this to be the 'The Watering Hole,' it is an apt name for this place, or at least the last part is. You enter the inn to the sight of gritty faces and dirty mugs. From the look of the men, this must be one of the dives of the Underways workers. You hold out your hand, palm up, giving the 'Pot's Peace' gesture to indicate you want no trouble and make your way to the bar. Eyes flash to the Free Company marks on your wrists as you pass.

You approach the innkeeper and ask what he knows of the deaths. "I know I'm losing the pool. Jimmy, you're supposed to be dead by now," he shouts over your shoulder to a man in the corner. Men chuckle and go back to their drinks. "Lost three good patrons this month. Randle swears he knows, wait … perhaps you can help that dunce. You wanna know what he knows? He's at the stocks. Try to get him out, will you? He's not a bad kid, just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut round the guards."
