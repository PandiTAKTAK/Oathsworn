Location 2 â€“ The Archive

You find the town archives and an irksome clerk named Millus. "The deaths, I presume," the clerk says dismissively. "I suppose you should follow me then. Everything is collected. You will not find our numbers wanting. Move nothing!"

The records Millus helps you sort through deal with a large list of missing persons, a pile dedicated to what appear to be suicides, and a tally of the local dead with the cause of death inked beside each name. The details are grisly, and some descriptions have no names attached where only bits of bodies and blood trails were all that remained, yet left no doubt that there was a killing.

"I don't know why you bother with the peasantry and their ilk. Their numbers wax and wane like the sun," he says derisively. "What should be of concern is my timber figures. Nine cords of wood marked used last month for various reasons. Mostly funerals. But records show only seven cords being pulled in. Two cords unaccounted for. What is this world coming to? Either the gatekeepers are not doing their job or someone's lying, and there's nothing worse than lying on a census. That's the real crime here!"
