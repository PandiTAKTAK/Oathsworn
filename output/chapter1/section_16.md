You squeeze through the small hole and find yourselves in the no man's land between the city walls and the Deepwood. You look off to the treeline and check your compass. This item is near sacred to you as well as all Free Companies. It is the only chance you have of navigating your way back after you enter the Deepwood. You steel yourself and head in.

Her great head of rotten fur and gnawing teeth rolls toward you and, with a ravenous hunger, her eyes meet yours.
