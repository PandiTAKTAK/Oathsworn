You look off to the treeline and check your compass. This item is near sacred to you as well as all Free Companies. It is the only chance you have of navigating your way back after you enter the Deepwood. You steel yourself and head in.

The trail is not hard to follow. The sickly brush is torn and trampled by many feet. A few hundred yards from the city walls, you come across a large, circular depression littered with scraps and bones. Then you see her, the hulking rat-like form of the Broodmother. She is twice the height of a man. Her back undulates with rats that swarm around her. At her feet is the torn body of a woman, evidently the source of the scream. This must be the woman Dane was looking for. The Broodmother lifts her huge snout, testing the air. Her great head of rotten fur and gnawing teeth rolls toward you and, with ravenous hunger, her eyes meet yours.
