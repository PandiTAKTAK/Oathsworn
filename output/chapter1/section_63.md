## Chapter 1 - Bastone

"Inn, tavern, or pub?" Midge grins. You're not sure what the difference is between the last two, but correct his expectations and explain that you need to know more about the bodies.

He shrugs, "Been nasty. They've been finding bodies and bits of bodies all over the slums for weeks now. Nobody does nothing until a noble was found dead and scattered about an alley."

Realization widens in his eyes. "Are you them, then? The Oathsworn?"

You nod and Midge grimaces. "Bugger, we didn't agree no hazard pay."

Ignoring the boy's comment you begin to question him about the town. He tells you of various locations and you begin to form a plan for the hunt. Bastone has many of the usual landmarks and there is a Banksmith and Apothecary to trade with for the supplies you may need for what is to come.
