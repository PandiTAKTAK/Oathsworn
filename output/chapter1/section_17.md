You squeeze through the small hole and find yourselves in the no man's land between the city walls and the Deepwood. You look off to the treeline and check your compass. This item is near sacred to you as well as all Free Companies. It is the only chance you have of navigating your way back after you enter the Deepwood. You steel yourself and head in.

The trail is not hard to follow. The sickly brush is torn and trampled by many feet. Half a league from the city walls you come across a large, circular depression littered with scraps and bones. That is when you see her, the hulking ratlike form of the Broodmother. She is twice the height of a man. Her back undulates with rats that swarm around her as she lifts her huge snout, testing the air. Her great head of rotten fur and gnawing teeth rolls towards you and, with ravenous hunger, her eyes meet yours.
