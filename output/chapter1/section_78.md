## Chapter 1 - Bastone

You surround the man, his head whipping between you as you walk slowly around him. You press him for what he knows, but looking back at his family, he stands tall. "I lost a young'un a week back and you come at me like this? You wanna know anything, you're paying double. Bunch of curs."

The man defies you and won't be browbeaten.

"It's the dead you need to find. People live, people die," he gestures to the wretched homeless lining the alley on either side of the street. "When they do, the collector comes to clear. It used to be me. Take bodies, take names if they had any, and burn them. No sickness then."

"Burning's expensive though. Hard to find people to go out to the Deepwood and cut the wood. Especially after that lot didn't come back. Collector gets his iron for each body he cleans from the streets. Costs nothing to just throw a body over the wall. Not right though. That ain't the job. That cur, Jeffit, undercut me and got the work. But I've seen him going to the wall and paying those guards at the eastmost tower. They look the other way and over they go. You find the bodies, you find the answers. And if you happen to kill that whoreson who stole my livelihood, then good riddance."
